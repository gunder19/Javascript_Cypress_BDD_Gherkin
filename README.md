TITLE: Demo on Cypress using CUCUMBER

Running Tests
Can be run from VScode the way tests normally are run

Description: In this, I have automated a website using cypress where we are also using "cucumber" which in turn uses "Gherkin" language to write feature file.
I have also implemented Page Object Model to manage the code.
To generate the report at the end, I have implemented Allure report handling.

Pre-requisites:
1.nodejs first and foremost 
2.cypress
3.Allure(to handle reports)
4.chai (assertion library)
